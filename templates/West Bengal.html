            Kantha Embroidery, from West Bengal (and Bangladesh), has an ancient history, originating as a frugal art where rural women repurposed old saris and dhotis. This traditional quilting and embroidery technique transformed discarded fabric into functional and decorative items. The beauty of Kantha lies in its simple running stitch that creates intricate motifs of flora, fauna, mythological figures, and daily life scenes. The subtle texture and often asymmetrical designs reveal a unique charm and personal narrative. Culturally significant, Kantha embodies domestic artistry, resourcefulness, and storytelling, often made for family members, especially children, reflecting shared experiences and spiritual beliefs.
